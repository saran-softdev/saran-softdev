## ‚≠ê Project Highlights

- **üíä Medical E-Commerce:** Created secure product management and an admin panel that‚Äôs healthier than a vitamin.
- **üéì LMS Platform:** Developed a learning platform with real-time Razorpay payments‚Äîbecause knowledge (and coffee) should never stop.

## üòÑ Why Commits Are Low

> "If you don‚Äôt see a commit every day, don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI‚Äôm just busy making client projects amazing from 9 to 6 (and sometimes, from 9 to 9!)."  
>  
> Between deploying user dashboards, chasing down bugs, and running coffee-fueled standups at work, my personal GitHub takes a little catnap. But when I do push, it‚Äôs quality you can count on (and usually after a strong cup of filter coffee).
